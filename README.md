# CADParser
## Introduction
This project was started by Frank Wang and Kevin Shao with an attempt to reimplement the [CADParser]([url](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/200)) paper. The CADParser was authored by Shengdi Zhou, Tianyi Tang, and Bin Zhou and published at the IJCAI (The International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence) in 2023. The main task of the paper is to generate construction command sequences from a given CAD geometry in the form of a BRep file.
