Data contains two parts: 

The all_npz.npz file contains the tokens of the construction sequence in vector forms. 
The graph data of the CAD is too large to be improted to github. So here is the shared link from google drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYlLTUUk5X35k5e5WvpwAjGtaqbHDtJ_/view?usp=sharing

The all_npz and the graph data contains about 6800 pairs of the face adjacency of the 3D CAD model and the construction sequence.
